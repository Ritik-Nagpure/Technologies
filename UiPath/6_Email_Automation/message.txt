Pathbreakers – An initiative where we will profile employees who have changed their paths and moved beyond their core responsibilities. In this series, we will talk about employees who have self-learned, used their talent and capabilities and made new paths for themselves. They have not only grown and enhanced themselves but have also been a great contributor for the project and company’s success. If you know anyone in your team who has changed their paths, domains, do contact us and we will surely profile them.







Best Regards,
Team AUTO ADM
