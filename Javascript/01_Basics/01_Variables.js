// Variables in Java script 

const pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi);

// changes constant is not allowed
//pi = 2 ;

// let variable cannot be used without declaration
//console.log(n);
let n = 'ritik';
console.log(n);

// var variable can be defined later and used before but its value will be undefined
// this is also called as Hoisting: declarations are considered on priority but not initialisations which means variable will declare first doesn't matter where its written but wil be intialsed only when pointer/thread comes to the line where it is initiated

console.log(nam);
var nam = 'ritik';
console.log(nam);
